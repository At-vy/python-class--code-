# operators and operand
i = 5 + 3 # here 5 and 3 are operands and "+" is an operator 
print(i)
# membershipp operator  operator 
fruits  = "mango"
print("m" in fruits) # here 'in' keyword is used as membership operator and returns 1 or 0 in the o/p 
print("k" in fruits) # here it returns false as k is  not present in fruits .
print("m" not in fruits ) # "not in" works inversely than "in".

# The python programing  follows PEMDAS rule
# P = paranthesis , E = exponential , M = multiplication D = division, A =  addition , S = substraction 
j = (5+3) * i**2 + 10 # expression
print(j)
# assignment operator
a = 10 # here '=' is assignment operator which assigns value 10 to variable a
print(a)
# comparison operator
b = 20
print(a == b) # here '==' is comparison operator which compares value of a and b
print(a != b) # '!=' not equal to operator
print(a > b)  # greater than operator
print(a < b)  # less than operator
print(a >= b) # greater than equal to operator
